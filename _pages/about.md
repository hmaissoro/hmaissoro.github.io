I am a third year PhD student in the [CREST](https://crest.science/user/Hassan-MAISSORO/) lab and [Datastorm](https://www.datastorm.fr/la-these-dhassan-maissoro-sur-les-donnees-fonctionnelles/), supervised by [Valentin Patilea](https://ensai.fr/equipe/valentin-patilea/) and [Myriam Vimond](https://ensai.fr/equipe/myriam-vimond/) of CREST-ENSAI.

My doctoral project is on dependent functional data with rough sample paths. My research focuses on capturing smoothness through local regularity parameters to improve the estimation of key parameters such as the mean function, autocovariance function and linear predictors for curve reconstruction, etc.
